        <h3>A sweet dumpling that is yummy for your tummy</h3>
        <p>I have chosen this recipe for my website as it was made for me recently and it is very simple to make.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <p>Dumplings</p>
            <li>1¼ Cups self raising flour</li>
            <li>30g soft butter</li>
            <li>⅓ Cup Golden Syrup</li>
            <p>Sauce</p>
            <li>30g butter</li>
            <li>175g brown sugar</li>
            <li>½ Cup Golden Syrup</li>
            <li>1½ Cups water</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Method</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the sauce by placing all ingredients into a large non-stick frypan or saute pan.</li>
            <li>Stir over a low heat until the brown sugar has dissolved. Then increase the heat until the mixture boils and turn the heat down to a simmer for one minute.</li>
            <li>Make the dumplings by rubbing the butter into the flour until it resembles breadcrumbs. Add the Chelsea Golden Syrup and milk and stir until just combined.</li>
            <li>Carefully drop spoonfuls of the dumpling batter into the simmering sauce leaving space for them to expand.</li>
            <li>Cover and cook for approx 20 minutes or until the dumplings are puffed and golden. You will need to turn the dumplings halfway through cooking.Serve with ice-cream, vanilla custard or thickened cream.</li>
        </ol>
